<h2>Abstract</h2><p>The EM-KPI ontology describes the key performance indicators and master data domains (energy, building, utility, occupancy, observation, weather, location) in energy management at district and building levels. It aims to exchange the multi-level performance information among various stakeholders and exploit the cross-domain data for energy performance improvement, so as to enhance the multi-level energy management. The ontology contains two parts: the KPI (key performance indicator) part and the EM (energy management) master data part; these respectively represent the multi-level performance information for energy performance tracking and the master data for data exploitation. </p>
